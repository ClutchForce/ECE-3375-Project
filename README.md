# ECE-3375-Project: Reflex Master

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Reflex Master game, a culminating project for the ECE-3375 Microprocessors course. Designed and developed by a team of enthusiastic engineering students, Reflex Master is a modern take on the classic reflex games, encouraging players to improve their cognitive skills and reaction times through fun and engaging gameplay.

## Project Overview

Reflex Master challenges players with a series of rapid-fire commands, such as "Bop it", "Pull it", and "Twist it", which they must execute before time runs out. This game not only offers entertainment but also serves as a tool for cognitive enhancement, suitable for individuals of all ages. By blending physical interaction with digital feedback, Reflex Master stands out as an innovative approach to traditional reflex games.
